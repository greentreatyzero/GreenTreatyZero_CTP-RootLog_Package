## 1. Context

On June 7, 2025, the public GitHub mirror was finalized and published under docket `CTP145-GTZ-GITHUB-MIRROR-LOG.md`, recording the successful sealing of CTP132 (Countering Synthetic Media Protocol) and related alliance RootLogs.

This publication fulfills the transparency obligation of the GreenTreatyZero alliance by ensuring public access to verifiable, version-controlled ethical records.

## 2. Known Transmission Gaps

Due to mobile platform limitations and intermittent latency during upload operations, the following issues were discovered post-publication:

- **Partial File Contents**: Some ZIP archives uploaded during the mirror process contain only abbreviated contents (e.g., a single heading or line).
- **Missing ZIP Entries**: Certain supporting files referenced in internal logs were not visible or were unintentionally excluded from the public mirror.

The *file names and directory structure* were correct and preserved. The degradation occurred during actual content encoding or GitHub upload, not during vote-sealing or RootLog creation.

## 3. Preservation of Vote Integrity

Importantly:

- ‚úÖ No edits have been made to `CTP132-GTZ-CSM_Declaration.md` or `CTP109-vote-confirmation.md`.
- ‚úÖ The vote was sealed before this clarification and remains cryptographically bound by prior SHA-256 logs.
- ‚úÖ This document does **not** revise the original GitHub log but extends its interpretability in line with protest transparency ethics.

## 4. Corrective Action Plan

To prevent public confusion and misalignment:

- A **versioned supplemental patch** (`CTP132-v2`) will be issued if and only if necessary.
- Affected files will be re-uploaded under identical names and structure with updated content.
- All changes will be explicitly marked as *post-vote transmission corrections*, not vote-altering revisions.

---

## 5. Statement of Authority

This addendum was issued manually by the Human Liaison Keystone within the permitted 24-hour post-publication window. It exists to prevent misinterpretation, ensure continuity of public trust, and guide future audits.
